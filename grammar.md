# Grammar

Norlunda grammar is incredibly simple. There is no grammatical gender, there are no case-based inflections for nouns, and there are only two irregular verbs (**vesan** _"to be"_, and **hebban**, _"to have"_).

With that said, because Norlunda vocabulary is algorithmically generated from real, Proto-Germanic vocabulary, not _every_ word can be conjugated in _exactly_ the same way. To keep things consistent and predictable, Norlunda simplifies what might otherwise have been myriad different patterns into just two: patterns belonging to **consonant stems**<sup>1</sup> and patterns belonging to **vowel stems**.

> 1. The difference between a consonant stem and a vowel stem is whether or not the lemma (in other words, the root, dictionary form of the word) ends with a consonant or a vowel.

## Personal pronouns

Norlunda defines personal pronouns in terms of four dimensions: perspective, number, gender, and case. However, for simplicity, the number of possible cases has been vastly reduced from what is often found in many Germanic languages. Although normal nouns do not follow the same rules for gender and case, these rules are required for clarity when dealing with pronouns.

Norlunda takes special care to include four separate categories of 3rd-person, singular pronouns: **masculine**, **feminine**, **animate**, and **inanimate**. The 3rd-person animate category can be used for any living being whose gender is unknown, ambiguous, or non-binary, while the 3rd-person inanimate category is used for non-living things.

## Definiteness

In Norlunda, there is one indefinite article, **an**. Plurals are formed by adding the suffix **-e** to consonant stems and **-r** to vowel stems. 

{: .showcase }
Ik har **an** apal.

{: .source}
I have an apple.

{: .showcase }
Du har apal**e**.

{: .source}
You have apples.

{: .showcase }
Vor haus har tien vindoga**r**.

{: .source}
Our house has ten windows.

Norlunda handles basic definiteness with the suffix **-en** for _all stems_. When combining this with a plural marker we get **-ene**.

{: .showcase }
Hun har apal**en**.

{: .source}
She has the apple.

{: .showcase }
Han har ander apal**ene**.

{: .source}
He has the other apples.

{: .showcase }
Die vasher all vindoga**ene**.

{: .source}
They wash all the windows.

## Demonstratives

Demonstrative pronouns in Norlunda can also be used as adjectives. When using a demonstrative as an adjective, there is no need to attach the definite suffix **-en** to the noun being described. However, we do need to use a plural demonstrative if it describes a plural noun.

<div class="scroll-size-1" markdown="1">

{: .striped-table .empty-th-1 .label-col-1 }
|              | Singular          | Plural              |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Nearby       | **dis** (this)    | **dise** (these)    |
| Mid-distance | **den** (that)    | **dene** (those)    |
| Far away     | **jein** (yonder) | **jeine** (yonder)  |

</div>

{: .showcase }
**Dis** ar gud.

{: .source}
This is good.

{: .showcase }
Ik har **dis** apal end du har **dene** apal**e**.

{: .source}
I have this apple and you have those apples.

{: .showcase }
Hens haus ar in **jein** holt.

{: .source}
His/her/their house is in yonder grove.

The demonstrative **den** is also useful for describing a concept as separate from an actual object. Consider the following examples:

{: .showcase }
**Den** follkomt mann ar aa glad.

{: .source}
The (conceptually) perfect man is always happy.

{: .showcase }
Follkomt mann**en** var aa glad.

{: .source}
The (actual) perfect man was always happy.

In the first example, we use **den** to discuss the concept of a perfect man. In the second example, we use the definite suffix **-en** to refer an actual man described as perfect.

## Sentence structure

Norlunda sentences are typically organized into subject-verb-object (SVO) order. Nouns are always either in standard case or genitive case (which is achieved by simply adding **-s**). When an indirect object is included, it may appear before the direct object or afterward if it is accompanied by a preposition.

{: .showcase }
Frauen**s** hond ar braun.

{: .source}
The woman's dog is brown. 

{: .showcase }
Ik gever Johan an apal. Han gever hans korn til mei.

{: .source}
I give John an apple. He gives his corn to me.

## Copula

One of Nolunda's only two irregular verbs (**vesan**, _"to be"_) is used to form the present and past tense copula. The present tense form of this verb is always **ar**, and the past tense form is always **var**. The copula can be used to express equality between subject and object or states of being.

{: .showcase }
Ik **ar** glad.

{: .source}
I am happy.

{: .showcase }
Hun **var** vudfoll.

{: .source}
She was furious.

{: .showcase }
Du **ar** an folk.

{: .source}
You are a human.

Whereas in English, the verb _"to be"_ can be used to express participle action, the same is not the case for **vesan**.

{: .showcase }
Vie et**er**.

{: .source}
We eat. / We are eating.

## Negation

The most basic negator in Norlunda is the word **naa** which means _"no"_ (in opposition to **ja**, _"yes"_). However, there are a few different ways to negate things depending on the context. Two other common, important negators are **ekka** and **nak**.

**Ekka** negates action and is similar to English _"not"_, however it never requires an auxiliary verb such as _"does"_:

{: .showcase }
Hun drinker **ekka**.

{: .source}
She drinks not. / She does not drink.

{: .showcase }
Varfor drinker hun **ekka**?

{: .source}
Why doesn't she drink?

**Nak**, on the other hand, is similar to English _"nothing"_ or _"naught"_.

{: .showcase }
Die eter **nak**.

{: .source}
They are eating nothing. / They are not eating anything.

## Verbs

Apart from **vesan**, Norlunda has one other irregular verb: **hebban** _"to have"_. The present tense form of this verb is always **har**, and the past tense form is always **hadde**.

{: .showcase }
Jie **har** jer apale end die **hadde** sin korn.

{: .source}
Y'all have y'all's apples and they had their corn.

Whereas other Germanic languages have a mix of strong and weak verbs, Norlunda does not. This means that every verb conjugates according to common rules. By default, infinitives take the suffix **-an** for consonant stems and **-n** for vowel stems.

{: .showcase }
rinn**an**, flieg**an**, see**n**

{: .source}
to run, to fly, to see

In imperative form, we simply remove suffixes from verb stems:

{: .showcase }
Rinn! Flieg! See!

{: .source}
Run! Fly! See!

To indicate present tense action, we use the suffix **-er** for consonant stems and **-r** for vowel stems.

{: .showcase }
Fogalen flieg**er**. Ik see**r** hem.

{: .source}
The bird is flying. I see him/her.

For past tense action, most verbs use the suffix **-de**. However, if the stem ends in most fricatives or stop consonants, we instead use **-te**<sup>1</sup>.

{: .showcase }
Fogalen flieg**te**. Ik see**de** hem.

{: .source }
The bird flew. I saw him/her.

> 1. The **⟨t⟩**-based suffixes are as follows: _-bte, -fte, -gte, -kte, -pte, -ste, -shte, -tte, -vte_, as well as any consonant cluster ending with **⟨t⟩**, for instance _-ndte_. This should feel fairly intuitive to most Germanic-language speakers.

Sometimes a noun needs to be _described_ in terms of action it is currently performing. In this case, we use the present participle suffix **-ande** for consonant stems and **-nde** for vowel stems.

{: .showcase }
Ik seer an rinn**ande** ross.

{: .source }
I see a running horse.

{: .showcase }
Ik seer an flie**nde** herr.

{: .source }
I see a fleeing army.

In English, the present participle is often used to mark in-progress action as distinct from habitual action (e.g., "I eat fish habitually" _vs._ "I am eating fish right now"). In Norlunda, the participle form is not used this way. Instead, the present tense suffix **-er** handles both cases.

A single instance of verb action can be treated as a noun by way of the suffix **-ing**.

{: .showcase }
Vie hadde an gud rinn**ing**.

{: .source }
We had a good run.

## Modal verbs

Some verbs are designed to show the possibility, intent, ability, or necessity of some action, as opposed to a real occurrence of action. We call these modal verbs.

A good rule of thumb for detemining whether or not a verb is modal is to ask yourself whether or not it makes sense with a noun as its direct object. For example, consider the English words _eat_ and _can_ (as in, to be able). The sentence “I eat a potato” makes sense, but the sentence “I can a potato” does not. _Can_ only works when used with other verbs, for example “I can eat”, which tells us that _can_ is modal. In Norlunda, modal verbs take no suffix in the present tense.

{: .showcase }
Ik **kon** drinkan.

{: .source }
I can drink.

The difference between present-tense modals and past-tense modals is a question of certainty. Present-tense modals show stronger intent or are more definitive, whereas past-tense modals are used with weaker assertions.

{: .showcase }
Ik **shol** rinnan.

{: .source }
I definitively intend to run. (I shall run.)

{: .showcase }
Ik **sholde** rinnan.

{: .source }
I have some intent to run but am less-committal. (I should run.)

## Stateful tense

When we need to describe something in terms of a new state it has taken on after having undergone the process of a verb, we use the suffix **-t** for most stems and **-it** for consonant stems that require a vowel sound in order to be followed by a "t" sound<sup>1</sup>. This is a pattern that merges a few different tenses across the Germanic spectrum into something Norlunda calls the **stateful tense**.

A good rule of thumb here is that if you run into a situation that doesn’t have a clear and obvious answer for conjugation, your safest bet is to use the stateful tense.

{: .showcase }
Henas vorde ar haar**it**. 

{: .source }
Her words are heard.

{: .showcase }
Buken var riet**it** dis jeer.

{: .source }
The book was written this year.

{: .showcase }
Du ar see**t**.

{: .source }
You are seen.

One other basic verb pattern is the "perfect tense". This is how we express the fact that some action already took place before the time frame being discussed. The result is usually a discussion about the state of a situation so we use the stateful tense for this in Norlunda. To construct perfect tense in Norlunda we add the verb **hebban** to a stateful conjugation.

{: .showcase }
Du **har** et**it**.

{: .source }
You have eaten.

{: .showcase }
Han **hadde** riet**it** buken.

{: .source }
He had written the book.

> 1. The consonant stems that require **-it** rather than **-t** for stateful tense are as follows: _-b, -d, -g, -t_. This should feel fairly intuitive to most Germanic-language speakers. 

## Comparisons

In Norlunda, the comparative suffix is **-ere** for consonant stems and **-re** for vowel stems. It is often used in connection with the comparative preposition **dan** (than). When pronouns are compared, they are always kept in subject form.

{: .showcase }
Han ar lang**ere** **dan** hun.

{: .source }
He is taller than her.

On a related note, the superlative suffix is **-est/-st** and it is normally used in connection with definite nouns.

{: .showcase }
Hen ar sveft**est** folk**en**.

{: .source }
He/she/they are the fastest person.

## Agent nouns

It is often useful to name someone as a habitual performer of some action, for example a hunter, a fighter, or a singer. In Norlunda, verbs become agent nouns by way of the suffix **-ar** for consonant stems and **-jar** for vowel stems. These suffixes can be appended with **-e** in the plural as expected.

{: .showcase }
An sing**ar** ar laudere dan jakk**are**.

{: .source }
A singer is louder than hunters.

{: .showcase }
Du flier oft. Du ar an flie**jar**.

{: .source }
You often flee. You are a fleer.

## Making adjectives

Norlunda has two categories of adjectival suffixes. The first category creates qualitative adjectives. In other words, adjectives used to describe a noun as having a particular quality or state of being. This category includes the suffix **-ig** for consonant stems and **-liek** for vowel stems.

The second category creates identitive adjectives. In other words, adjectives used to describe a noun in terms of its origin, belonging to a group, or behavioral tendency. This category includes the suffix **-sh** for most consonant stems, or **-ish** for stems where a vowel is required in order to make pronunciation possible. For vowel stems, the final vowel is dropped and replaced with **-ish**.

{: .showcase }
Han ar an heil**ig** mann.

{: .source }
He is a holy man.

{: .showcase }
Ik seede dur aaga**liek** vindogaen.

{: .source }
I looked through the eye-like window.

{: .showcase }
Hun ar an frank**ish** frau.

{: .source }
She is a French woman.

{: .showcase }
Du ar an kanad**ish** folk av Kanada.

{: .source }
You are a Canadian person from Canada.
