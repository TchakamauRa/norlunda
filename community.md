# Community

Norlunda is a community project currently led by **John Newman**. Discussion and decision making occur on the Norlunda Discord server which is freely accessible here: [https://discord.gg/AGvmXRhscG](https://discord.gg/AGvmXRhscG).

## The flag

![The Norlunda flag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/flag.svg)

The Norlunda flag is a **6:4** rectangle portraying an abstract, white sprig over an aqua field.

The white color is named **Viet** (#FFFFFF) and the aqua color is named **Holtvator** (#1FBCBC).

The sprig in the center of the flag is centered both vertically and horizontally, and within the flag’s 6:4 ratio, it is **3** tall. Knowing the exact proportions of every line is not that important, however, as the flag can be downloaded in scalable vector from this page.

The sprig, which we call the **Sprut**, is inspired by renditions of the mythological World Tree, commonly known as Yggdrasil, as seen in the medieval [Överhogdal tapestries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96verhogdal_tapestries). However, the Sprut is not the full, mature tree, but a young sprig, symbolizing the idea of a new world joined in togetherness coming in the future. It’s a hopeful ideal which Norlunda aspires to work toward in some small measure.
