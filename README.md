# norlunda

An algorithmically generated conlang merging north and west Germanic linguistic features

This is still a work in progress but to run things for now you need node.js and npm. Then you can run the script by passing in a Proto-Germanic word like this:

```
npm start -- wrītaną
```

You will get output telling you the generated Norlunda word as well as how the word changed with each step in the process.
