# Norlunda

An algorithmically generated conlang merging north and west Germanic linguistic features

This is still a work in progress but to run things for now you need node.js and npm. Then you can run the script by passing in a Proto-Germanic word like this:

```
npm run word -- wrītaną
```

You will get output telling you the generated Norlunda word as well as how the word changed with each step in the process.

To run the site, you will need Ruby and Jekyll, then run `npm run start`.

To build a new version of the algorithm into the site, run `npm run build`.
