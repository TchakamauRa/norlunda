## Purpose

Norlunda is designed to be the easiest Germanic language to learn. Its grammar should be fully digestible within a single day of study for any current Germanic speaker. It should consist of equal parts North and West Germanic character.

With that in mind, Norlunda is not meant to reflect a simplest common denominator among all modern Germanic languages or to be immediately and fully comprehensible to every current Germanic speaker. Instead, it should be an independent language with its own mood and personality.
