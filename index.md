# Vilkoman til Norlunda!

{: .intro-copy }
Norlunda is a **near-fully-automated**, Germanic conlang. It blends characteristics of both the North and West branches of the Germanic language family to create a smooth and pleasing result thatâ€™s quick and easy to learn for all Germanic speakers.

## How it works

Norlunda vocabulary is algorithmically generated from Proto-Germanic vocabulary. Once a word is chosen as a Proto-Germanic basis for a Norlunda word, it is run through a hand-crafted set of sound change rules designed to simulate over 2,000 years of language evolution to arrive at a realistic, modern result.

While it's possible to apply these rules by hand, it is much easier to let computers do the work for us. Thus, the sound change algorithm has been fully automated and you can <a data-modal-trigger="generator">try it for yourself</a> right now!

Norlunda is designed to be the easiest Germanic language to learn. Its grammar is designed to be fully digestible within a single day of study for any current Germanic speaker, and the language consists of equal parts North and West Germanic character.

## Near-fully-automated

Language evolution isn't perfectly mathematical. Sometimes it's necessary for humans to step in and make decisions. Also, whereas Norlunda's vocabulary can be algorithmically generated, its grammar can not. In order to achieve an equal measure of North and West Germanic character, Norlunda's vocabulary leans on West Germanic patterns while its grammar leans North. In the end, the language is unique, easy, and fun to learn.
