# Principles

Updated 2023.10.16

Norlunda is designed to be the easiest Germanic language to learn, presenting quickly digestible grammar and a fair compromise between North and West Germanic branches. However, it is not meant to reflect a simplest common denominator among all modern Germanic languages or to be immediately and fully comprehensible to every current Germanic speaker. Instead, it should be an independent language with its own mood and personality.

With that said, achieving perfect equilibrium between North and West Germanic language features is likely impossible. Arbitrarily lifting vocabulary and grammar rules from various languages across the Germanic spectrum results in a messy, unpredictable system. Additionally, without a codified algorithm for generating vocabulary, and without a strong process for making decisions as a community, the language is bound to fracture and fizzle out. To combat these problems, Norlunda is built on the following principles:

## The North-West Compromise

To generate Norlunda vocabulary, we apply a customized (and automated!) algorithm of sound changes to Proto-Germanic words designed to provide Norlunda with a consistent, predictable phonology. However, it is not always possible to find a PGmc cognate whose descendants have retained a similar meaning across the entire Germanic spectrum. When this happens, we lean toward selecting cognates that have been preserved in West-Germanic languages. However, we don’t want the language to be too West-leaning as a whole so, to compensate for this, we apply a system of pronouns, declensions, conjugations, and other grammar rules inspired by the North Germanic branch. In the end, Norlunda vocabulary leans West while its grammar leans North.

## Method

Norlunda is meant to be a community effort that does not require linguistic expertise in order to participate. It’s also **just for fun**. So our method for building the language reflects this.

To generate new vocabulary, we translate a word into many Germanic languages, looking for a pattern of cognates. It is perfectly acceptable to do this via [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) or some similar tool. Sometimes multiple patterns emerge, sometimes no patterns emerge, and sometimes there is a clear and obvious pattern shared by most languages (for example, “book”, “Buch”, “boek”, and “bok” all exhibit a clear pattern). If there is no obvious pattern, we choose a direction based on the [Principles for Decision Making](#principles-for-decision-making) as described below.

Once we find a pattern, we track down the origin of this pattern in Proto-Germanic. It is perfectly acceptable to do this via looking up the etymology of a word on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page). Sometimes we may find a pattern but end up discovering that it falls afoul of our Principles. If that happens, we start looking for a new pattern or for a different way to express a concept.

When we’ve finally isolated a Proto-Germanic cognate, we apply a customized [Sound Change Algorithm]({{ site.baseurl }}/algorithm) designed to simulate 2,000 years of linguistic evolution to arrive at the final word. From here, we add it to the **Vordbuk** ([dictionary]({{ site.baseurl }}/dictionary)) and celebrate our success.

## Priniciples for Decision Making

{: .mb-8 }
Over time, decisions will need to be made to evolve the language. To serve as guideposts in those decisions, we will rely on the following principles:
1. **We should avoid homonyms where possible.** We can remove an entire class of potential confusion for language learners if every word has a single meaning.
1. **We should avoid non-Germanic loanwords where possible.** Words of foreign origin tend to add additional linguistic patterns to the language and supplant perfectly good, shared cognates, thus adding unnecessary complexity. (We’ll call sushi “sushi” but we won’t call a rash “urticaria”.)
1. **The more cross-language cognates the better.** Norlunda will be more accessible to more people if we pick a direction that is shared by more languages. When the direction isn’t clear, we pick a word from a W.G. language.
1. **Single words are better than compounds or multi-word phrases.** For simplicity’s sake, it is better to say “sorry” than “es tut mir leid” (sorry, German).
1. **Community decisions are better than unilateral decisions.** Sometimes there’s no obvious solution to a problem and a bit of creativity is required. In those cases, the community should pick a creative solution together where possible. (Feel free to join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/AGvmXRhscG).)
