Neer miek! Vat liet dur jein vindoga breker? Dee ar ostaren, end Juliet ar sonnen. Upstaa, shaan sonn, end slaa den avundsiek maanen, den ar alreid siek end bleik av sorga, forden du, henas meid, ar mikel shaanere dan hun.

"But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair than she." –Romeo and Juliet

All Norlunda words are spelled phonetically. The following tables map phonemes to their respective spellings.

## Vowels

{: .striped-table }
| Spelling | Phoneme | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| a | /a/ | **apal** (apple) |
| aa | /ɔː/ | **saa** (so) |
| au | /au/ | **trau** (true) |
| e | /ə/ <sup>1</sup> | **hande** (hands) |
| e | /ɛ/ | **bedd** (bed) |
| ee | /eː/ | **feer** (four) |
| ei | /ai/ | **heim** (home) |
| i | /ɪ/ | **bindan** (to bind) |
| ie | /iː/ | **bie** (bee) |
| o | /o/ | **donar** (thunder) |
| œ, oe <sup>2</sup> | /œː/ | **bœr** (berry) |
| u | /u/ | **buk** (book) |

> 1. The letter **⟨e⟩** only produces the schwa sound **/ə/** at the end of a word.
> 2. The letter **⟨œ⟩** is the formal spelling of this sound, however the digraph **⟨oe⟩** is an acceptable alternative for keyboards without easy access to **⟨œ⟩**.

Note that Norlunda contains 6 short vowels, 4 long vowels, and 2 diphthongs. Learners who are not used to semantic differences between long and short vowels will be happy to see that all of Norlunda's long vowels also have a different vowel quality from all of its short vowels. Thus, if your pronunciation is correct, there is never any risk of saying the wrong word just because vowel length wasn't perfect.

## Consonants

{: .striped-table }
| Spelling | Phoneme | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| b | /b/ | **beer** (bear) |
| d | /d/ | **dag** (day) |
| f | /f/ | **fogal** (bird) |
| g | /ʝ/ <sup>1</sup> | **fliegan** (to fly) |
| g | /g/ | **gold** (gold) |
| h | /h/ | **hert** (heart) |
| j | /j/ | **ja** (yes) |
| k | /k/ | **konnan** (to be able) |
| l | /l/ | **lovan** (to love) |
| m | /m/ | **mann** (man) |
| n | /n/ | **nord** (north) |
| ng | /ŋ/ | **jong** (young) |
| p | /p/ | **spelan** (to play) |
| r | /ɾ/ | **ross** (horse) |
| s | /s/ | **stein** (stone) |
| sh | /ʃ/ | **shada** (shadow) |
| t | /t/ | **tien** (ten) |
| tsh | /t̠ʃ | **dautsh** (native language) |
| v | /v/ | **vord** (word) |
| x | /ks/ | **fox** (fox) |

> 1. The letter **⟨g⟩** produces the **/ʝ/** sound when between vowels or when ending a word after a vowel.

Apart from those listed above, Norlunda also uses foreign consonant letters for spelling words with sounds that do not exist natively in Norlunda. For example, English _zoom_ and German _holz_ may both be spelled with **⟨z⟩**. There is no need to approximate these sounds with different spellings.

Consonants in Norlunda may be doupled at times. When this happens, the doubled consonant is meant to be held longer than a single consonant. For instance, _mann_ is pronounced **/manː/**. It is highly unlikely that failing to pronounce a long consonant will result in being misunderstood.
